## Background

A café has seen unprecedented growth and has expanded to hundreds of outlets across the country.
Due to the demand the company is receiving, they need to figure out how they can best target new and returning customers, and also understand which products are selling well.
They are experiencing issues with collating and analysing the data they are producing at each branch, as their technical setup is limited.
We have been asked to step in and provide consultation on what they need to do in order to grow their technical offerings, so that they can continue to accelerate their growth.
## Current Setup
Every day, the following occurs for each branch:
-  A CSV file containing data about every transaction they made for that day is generated.
- At 8pm, the data is uploaded to a piece of software installed in the back office computers.
- Daily, weekly or monthly reports for sales figures and other related business metrics are created.
## The Problem
- The software currently being used only generates reports for single branches.
- It is time consuming to collate data on all branches.
- Gathering meaningful data for the company on the whole is difficult, due to the limitations of the software.
- The company currently has no way of identifying trends.
## The Solution
After a thorough analysis and discovery of what the client is looking for, a plan has been fleshed out. We have been tasked with building a fully scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to handle large volumes of transaction data for the business. This pipeline will collect all the transaction data generated by each individual café and place it in a single location. By being able to easily query the company's data as a whole, the client will drastically increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights.
## Requirements
- Each night a CSV for each branch will be uploaded to the cloud.
- The system we have developed will read each file and perform ETL steps.
- Data will be stored in a datawarehouse.
- Data analytics software will be used to create Business Intelligence analytics for the client.
- Application monitoring software will be used to produce operational metrics, such as system errors, up-time and more.
## Ways of Working

The project will consist of fivesprints, where each sprint is a week in length.

#### Sprint 1
- Extraction of data
- Removal of senesitve data
- Design schema to model data
- Normalise data to 3NF
- Create SQL script to generate
- Setup docker-compose file to create network of containers

#### Sprint 2
